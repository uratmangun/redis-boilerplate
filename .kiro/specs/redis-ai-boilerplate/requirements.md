# Redis AI Boilerplate Requirements

## Introduction

A comprehensive Redis boilerplate React application integrated with Cloudflare and Deno, featuring AI-powered semantic search capabilities, real-time data storage, and modern UI/UX design. This project serves as a template for developers to quickly bootstrap Redis-based applications with advanced AI features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Redis Boilerplate Hero Section

**User Story:** As a developer visiting the boilerplate, I want to see a clear Redis-focused hero section, so that I understand this is a Redis template and can quickly identify its purpose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN the system SHALL display a "Redis Boilerplate" title with Redis-themed description
2. WHEN the hero section loads THEN the system SHALL show a red-orange gradient styling consistent with Redis branding
3. WHEN the hero section is displayed THEN the system SHALL include clear instructions for using the template

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered Semantic Search Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with an AI-powered search interface, so that I can understand how to implement semantic search with Redis Vector Search.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Try AI Search" THEN the system SHALL navigate to a dedicated AI Search page
2. WHEN the AI Search page loads THEN the system SHALL display a search input supporting natural language queries
3. WHEN a user performs a search THEN the system SHALL return results with titles, content, categories, and relevance scores
4. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show items organized by relevance score

### Requirement 3: Item Management System

**User Story:** As a developer testing the boilerplate, I want to add new items to the Redis database, so that I can see how data storage and retrieval works in practice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the AI Search page THEN the system SHALL display an "Add New Item" form at the top
2. WHEN a user fills out the form with title and content THEN the system SHALL validate required fields
3. WHEN a user submits a valid item THEN the system SHALL store it in Redis database with a unique ID
4. WHEN an item is successfully added THEN the system SHALL display a success message with the Redis-generated item ID
5. WHEN an item is added THEN the system SHALL immediately show it in the search results for instant feedback

### Requirement 4: Redis Backend Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want functional Deno serverless functions that interact with Redis, so that I can understand how to implement Redis operations in a serverless environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs to add an item THEN it SHALL use the `/functions/add-item.ts` Deno function
2. WHEN the system needs to search items THEN it SHALL use the `/functions/search-items.ts` Deno function
3. WHEN Redis operations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle CORS properly for development
4. WHEN Redis is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful fallback behavior
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages to users

### Requirement 5: Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the boilerplate, I want clear documentation of required environment variables, so that I can quickly configure Redis connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer clones the repository THEN the system SHALL provide a `.env.example` file
2. WHEN viewing the example file THEN it SHALL include Redis connection URLs for multiple providers
3. WHEN reading the documentation THEN it SHALL include setup instructions for local, cloud, and serverless Redis
4. WHEN configuring for deployment THEN it SHALL provide platform-specific environment variable guidance

### Requirement 6: Modern UI/UX Design

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating the boilerplate, I want to see a modern, responsive UI design, so that I can assess the quality and usability of the template.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, centered UI with responsive design
2. WHEN viewing on different devices THEN the system SHALL maintain proper layout and readability
3. WHEN interacting with forms THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback and validation
4. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling and branding
5. WHEN using dark mode THEN the system SHALL properly support dark theme styling

### Requirement 7: Template Repository Features

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily create a new project from this boilerplate, so that I can quickly start building my own Redis application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the homepage THEN the system SHALL display GitHub CLI instructions for template creation
2. WHEN following the instructions THEN a developer SHALL be able to create a new repository from the template
3. WHEN the new repository is created THEN it SHALL include all necessary files and configurations
4. WHEN setting up the new project THEN the developer SHALL have clear documentation for Redis setup and deployment
