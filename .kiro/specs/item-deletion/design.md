# Item Deletion Feature Design

## Architecture Overview

The deletion feature consists of:

1. Frontend UI component in AISearchPage.tsx
2. API endpoint in /functions/delete-item.ts
3. Redis client operations

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Component

- Delete button appears conditionally when item is found
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- Loading state during async operation
- Real-time UI updates via state management

### API Endpoint

- Handles both DELETE and POST methods
- Connects to Redis via redisClient
- Implements proper error handling
- Returns deleted item data for confirmation

### Redis Operations

- Uses DEL command to remove item by ID
- Cleans up search indexes after deletion
- Handles connection errors gracefully

## Component Design

### DeleteButton Component

- **Purpose**: Triggers deletion flow
- **Dependencies**: AISearchPage state, delete API
- **Interface**: onClick handler, loading state

### DeleteItemFunction

- **Purpose**: Handles item deletion logic
- **Dependencies**: Redis client, CORS settings
- **Interface**: HTTP endpoint at /delete-item

## Data Flow

1. User clicks delete button
2. Frontend calls /delete-item endpoint
3. Backend removes item from Redis
4. Backend returns deleted item data
5. Frontend updates UI state

## Technical Considerations

- CORS properly configured for DELETE method
- Redis connection pooling for performance
- Error handling for all failure cases
