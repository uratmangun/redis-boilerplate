# Cloudflare & Deno Integration Requirements

## Introduction
This specification outlines the requirements for integrating Cloudflare Pages with Deno Deploy to create a seamless full-stack application with serverless functions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Cloudflare Pages Integration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy my React application to Cloudflare Pages so that it is served with high performance and global availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the application is pushed to the repository, THEN it SHALL be automatically deployed to Cloudflare Pages
2. WHEN the application is deployed, THEN it SHALL be accessible via a Cloudflare Pages URL
3. WHEN environment variables are updated, THEN they SHALL be automatically synchronized with Cloudflare Pages

### Requirement 2: Deno Serverless Functions
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create and deploy Deno serverless functions that can be called from my React application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a Deno function is created in the `/functions` directory, THEN it SHALL be automatically exposed via the API
2. WHEN the React application calls a function, THEN it SHALL receive a proper response
3. WHEN a function is updated, THEN the changes SHALL be reflected after deployment

### Requirement 3: Local Development Environment
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run both the React app and Deno functions locally for development and testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN running `pnpm dev`, THEN both the React app and Deno server SHALL start concurrently
2. WHEN making changes to React components, THEN the app SHALL hot-reload
3. WHEN making changes to Deno functions, THEN the server SHALL automatically restart

### Requirement 4: Automated Deployment Pipeline
**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated deployment pipeline that handles both frontend and backend deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch, THEN it SHALL trigger the deployment workflow
2. WHEN the workflow runs, THEN it SHALL deploy the React app to Cloudflare Pages
3. WHEN the workflow runs, THEN it SHALL deploy the Deno functions to Deno Deploy
4. WHEN the deployment succeeds, THEN the Deno Deploy URL SHALL be automatically set as an environment variable in Cloudflare Pages
