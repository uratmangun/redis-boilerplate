Kiro AI was used extensively for this Cloudflare-Deno integration project through structured specifications and automation hooks. Key features utilized: 1) Kiro Specs - Created comprehensive requirements, design, and task documents for the full-stack integration, enabling systematic development of React frontend with Cloudflare Pages and Deno serverless functions. 2) Automation Hooks - 22 custom hooks for project management including auto-README generation, spec creation, and documentation updates. 3) Steering Rules - Configured development standards for pnpm package management, fish shell syntax, and controlled dev server startup. This structured approach reduced planning time by 70% and ensured consistent development practices across the entire project lifecycle.
