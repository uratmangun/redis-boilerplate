Kiro excels at structured development workflows. Start with specs for complex features - define requirements, iterate on design, then implement incrementally. Use steering rules for team standards and project context. For impressive results: scaffold full-stack apps with proper TypeScript configs, create complete component libraries with accessibility, build deployment pipelines with error handling. Key tips: be specific about requirements, use file references in specs, leverage parallel tool execution for speed.
