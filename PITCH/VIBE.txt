Structured Kiro conversations around spec-driven development: start with requirements gathering, create technical design documents, then break into discrete implementation tasks. Most impressive: Kiro generated complete React components, Deno serverless functions, and Redis integration code from specifications. Key workflow: use hooks for automation, steering rules for consistency, and specs for complex features. Kiro excels at understanding context across multiple files and maintaining architectural coherence throughout development.
