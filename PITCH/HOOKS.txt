Automated 23 development workflows with Kiro hooks including auto-README generation, commit automation, spec creation, and documentation generation. Key hooks: auto-commit-push for conventional commits with emojis, auto-readme-generator for project documentation, create-kiro-spec for structured development planning, and content generation hooks for pitches and blogs. These hooks eliminated manual documentation tasks, ensured consistent commit messages, and streamlined the spec-driven development process, saving hours of repetitive work.
