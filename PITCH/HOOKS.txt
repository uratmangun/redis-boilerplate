Automated 22 development workflows with Kiro hooks: auto-README generation, git commit/push automation, Kiro spec creation, filename synchronization, project boilerplate generation, asset copying across projects, Kiro-to-Windsurf conversion, OSI license creation, and documentation updates. These hooks eliminated repetitive tasks, ensured consistency across projects, automated documentation maintenance, and streamlined the development process by triggering on file changes or user commands.
