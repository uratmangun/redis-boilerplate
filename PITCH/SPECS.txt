Kiro specs provide structured feature development through three key files: requirements.md defines user stories with acceptance criteria, design.md outlines technical architecture and data flow, and tasks.md breaks implementation into trackable steps. This spec-driven approach enables incremental development with clear requirements traceability, systematic design documentation, and progress tracking. The Cloudflare-Deno integration spec demonstrates how complex full-stack features are decomposed into manageable tasks.
