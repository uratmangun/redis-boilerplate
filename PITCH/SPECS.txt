Implemented spec-driven development with 4 comprehensive Kiro specifications covering Redis AI boilerplate, Cloudflare-Deno integration, item deletion, and server polish. Each spec follows structured format: requirements.md with user stories and EARS acceptance criteria, design.md with architecture and technical decisions, tasks.md with discrete implementation steps. This approach enabled systematic feature development, clear progress tracking, and maintainable codebase with 13 completed tasks per spec.
